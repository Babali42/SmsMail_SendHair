* S: Single responsibility Principle
* O: Open/Closed Principle
* L: Liskov Substitution Principle
* I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle states "that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule."



* D: Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
